# Oboo Runtime

Lightweight Javascript ES5 runtime

## Runtime Intro

C code:

* All located in `oboo-runtime` directory
* `ort.c`
	* Holds `main()` function
* `runtime.c`
	* Defines all C functions that can be used in Javascript
	* `initRuntime()` function registers these C functions for use in Javascript
	* Embedded Javascript engine
		* Using `duktape` library
		* Really good documentation online: https://duktape.org/
* `messageQueue.c`
	* Holds all MQTT functions
	* Based on `mosquitto` library
* `serialPort.c`
	* Holds all serial port communication functions
	* Based on `termios` library

Compiled `ort` binary should be run as follows:

```
./ort <path to JS file>
```

## Quickstart

* Make sure mosquitto broker is running
	* `service mosquitto start`
* Compile the code
	* `make`
* Run the test program
	* `make test`

## Exiting a Runtime Program

Currently, it's only possible to exit an Oboo Runtime Javascript program in the JS `loop()` function by returning `-1`.

Example:

```
function loop() {
	if (globalVar === true) {
		// exit this program
		return -1;
	} else {
		print('Still running!');
	}
}
```

## Hardware Interaction

All received MQTT messages call the `onRecvMessage()` function that's defined in `oboo-runtime/js/card-lib.js`.

This function will then call `onInput()` or `onMessage()` functions that **must** be defined in each Oboo Runtime Javascript program to function properly.

### MQTT Messages

Regular MQTT messages will be passed as follows:

```
onMessage({
	topic: messageTopic,
	payload: messagePayload
})
```

### Hardware Input

User input from the touch pad or gesture sensor will be passed to the Oboo Runtime Javascript program through the `onInput()`.

#### Touch Input

The Hardware supports multi-touch (detection of simultaneous presses of multiple buttons) and tracks the duration of the button press. The message will be sent out when the button is released.

##### Single Touches

For single touch button presses, it will be invoked as follows:

```
onInput({
	source: 'button',
	payload: {
		id: buttonId, // defines buttons left to right as 0 to 3
		action: 'press',
		duration: 123, 	// time in milliseconds button was pressed
		multitouch: false
	}
});
```

##### Multi-Touch

For multi-touch, the function will be invoked as follows:

```
onInput({
	source: 'button',
	payload: {
		id: buttonByte, // see description below
		action: 'press',
		duration: 123, 	// time in milliseconds button was pressed
		multitouch: true
	}
});
```

The `buttonByte` is an integer, with each bit representing a different button:

| Bit 3                     | Bit 2    | Bit 1    | Bit 0                    |
|---------------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| Button 3 (Farthest Right) | Button 2 | Button 1 | Button 0 (Farthest Left) |

So a value of `14` or `0xe` in hex would be `0b1110`, meaning buttons 1-3 were pressed.

#### Gesture Input

For gesture input, it will be invoked as follows:

```
onInput({
	source: 'gesture',
	payload: {
		direction: ['left'|'right'|'up'|'down'|'none']
	}
});
```
